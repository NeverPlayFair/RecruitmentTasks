# Recruitment Coding Tasks - Warsaw Corporation üáµüá±

A collection of recruitment-style coding tasks from a Warsaw-based corporation, implemented in Java. These tasks are intended to evaluate problem-solving and programming skills in a technical interview setting. Below you'll find detailed explanations of each solution, demonstrating how to approach typical coding interview problems in Java.

## Introduction

This repository contains Java-based solutions to a series of programming challenges used in the recruitment process for a major Warsaw-based company. The tasks cover a variety of programming concepts including:
- String manipulation
- Array operations
- Sorting algorithms
- Character type identification

## Task Descriptions

### Task 1: Generating Alternating String ###

<h5> Please write a function that will take an int n value as a parameter but will
return a String of length n, which will contain the characters: "+" and "-",
starting with a "+" character.
For example, for given n=5, your function should return "+-+-+", and for
given n=8 it should return "+-+-+-+-". </h5>

### Task 2: Sum of Array Elements ###

<h5> The program below calculates the sum of the elements of the array passed to the method. Unfortunately, the program
does not work properly in some cases, find the bug(s) and modify the code so that the program works properly.
Note that for the example test case the program works fine: </h5>

Console:
The sum of the numbers in the array is: 10

I fixed a bug in a program that calculates the sum of elements in an integer array. Initially, the loop skipped the first element of the array.

## Task Descriptions

### Task 3: Balanced Array ###

<h5> Write a program that, for a given int n (1 ‚â§ n ‚â§ 100), will return an array
containing n non-repeating integers, the sum of which will be 0. The
program can return any such array.
For example, for a given int n = 4, the program could return [1,0,-3,2], and for
an int n = 3 one possible response is [-1, 0.1] ‚Äì but there are many more
correct answers. </h5>

## Task Descriptions

### Task 4: Largest Sibling Number ###

<h5> Two non-negative integers are called siblings if they can be obtained from each other by
rearranging the digits of their decimal representations. For example, 123 and 213 are
siblings, 535 and 355 are also siblings.
A set consisting of a non-negative integer n and all of its siblings is called the family of n.
For example, the family of 553 comprises three numbers: 355, 535, and 553.
Write program that, for given a non-negative integer n, returns the largest numer in the
family of n.
For example, given n=213 the function should return 321. Given n = 553 the function
should return 553.
Assume that, n is an integer within the range: 0 ‚â§ n ‚â§ 10 000 </h5>

## Task Descriptions

### Task 5: Character Type Check ###

<h5> Please complete an implementation of a method repFirstChar, that
should return a string describing first character of the given string.
So for: an uppercase letter ‚Äûupper‚Äù, for lowercase letter ‚Äûlower‚Äù, for digit
‚Äûdigit‚Äù and for other characters ‚Äûother‚Äù. You can assume the characters
are ASCII. </h5>
